Data analysis from Master School Project using [Metrocar Database](postgres://Test:bQNxVzJL4g6u@ep-noisy-flower-846766-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/Metrocar)
The objective is to perform funnel analysis to the transportation app called 'Metrocar' to see which stages of app need further improvement. Funnel analysis is performed through SQL query using [Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/) and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) is used to visualize funnel analysis data. As a result, The step that requires improvement is riding complete, and the suggestion is to study the ride management system further because it might have some issues that cause the users to cancel requests. Moreover, iOs is the platform that users use the most and the target group age is 35 - 44. Speaking about the peak time, 8.00 - 9.00 and 16.00 - 17.00 are the prime time that can adopt a surge pricing strategy.
